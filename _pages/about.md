Hi there, 

This is Fangda Han, I currently work on my PhD in computer science at [SeQaM Lab](ttp://seqamlab.com/), Rutgers University with [Vladimir Pavlovic](http://seqamlab.com/profile/?smid=218). 

Before joining Rutgers, I finished my master in Engineering Physics at Tsinghua University under [Yongshun Xiao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yongshun_Xiao2), as well as my bachelor in Engineering Physics at Tsinghua Univerisity.

My interests are in machine learning now, specifically in computer vision and deep learning, more specifically in feature extraction and image generation.
I also take pictures and learn Spanish!
